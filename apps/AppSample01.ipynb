        "\n",
        "+ This Python code is part of an interactive language learning application designed to help learners practice sentence structure. It demonstrates how one can use Python and its libraries to create educational tools.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's how the application works:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Sentence Input: Learners begin by typing a complete sentence into a text box. This sentence is what they will work with in the exercise.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Sentence Splitting: The application takes the input sentence and splits it into three parts. This is done programmatically by dividing the number of words roughly into thirds, ensuring that the sentence is broken down into sizable chunks for the learner to rearrange.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Shuffling and Display: The three parts of the sentence are then shuffled and displayed in a randomized order. Each part is numbered so the learner can reference them when typing their answer.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Interactive Response: The learner is prompted to type the correct order of the parts to reconstruct the original sentence. They input their answer in the form of a sequence of numbers (e.g., \"231\" to indicate that the second part comes first, followed by the third, then the first part).\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Verification and Feedback: After submitting their answer, the application checks if the sequence of numbers matches the correct order of the original sentence. If the learner's answer is correct, they receive a congratulatory message. If not, they are prompted to try again, with the parts displayed for another attempt.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Repetition Until Success: This process repeats, with the parts being shuffled each time, until the learner inputs the correct order. There's no limit to the number of attempts, providing a stress-free learning environment where the learner can practice at their own pace.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. Applicability: Such an application can be expanded with features like hints, time limits, or a scoring system to gamify the learning experience. It's an example of how Python's interactive capabilities can be leveraged in educational technology to create engaging and effective learning tools.\n",
