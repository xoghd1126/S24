        "\n",
        "## 2. Use of Flashcards:\n",
        "Flashcards are a staple in language learning, especially for vocabulary building and spelling.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 3.  Dictation:\n",
        "Teachers dictate words and sentences aloud, and students write them down as accurately as they can. This tests not only their listening skills but also their ability to connect sounds with letters and words.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 4. Spelling Tests:\n",
        "Regular spelling tests are a common feature in traditional classrooms. These might be straightforward tests where students write down words from memory, or they could be in the form of quizzes that include multiple-choice questions or cloze tests.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Note:\n",
        "In Korea, and many other Asian educational settings, there is a strong emphasis on test scores and academic performance, which often drives the reliance on memorization techniques. While effective for some students, these methods can be challenging for others who might benefit from more interactive or contextually rich learning experiences."
